Overview
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and is widely used in machine learning, computer graphics, and scientific computing. In this project, we implement matrix multiplication in Java, ensuring that the program handles incompatible matrix sizes gracefully.

The program consists of two classes:

Matrix: Contains the multiply method to multiply two matrices.

MatrixRunner: Demonstrates the usage of the multiply method and prints the result.

Code Explanation
Matrix Class
The Matrix class contains a static method multiply that takes two 2D arrays (matrices) as input and returns their product. The method follows these steps:

Compatibility Check: It first checks if the number of columns in the first matrix (a) matches the number of rows in the second matrix (b). If not, it returns a null matrix.

Result Matrix Initialization: If the matrices are compatible, it initializes a result matrix with dimensions [rows of a] x [columns of b].

Matrix Multiplication: It iterates through the rows of a and columns of b, computing the dot product for each element of the result matrix.

The MatrixRunner class demonstrates the usage of the multiply method. It defines two matrices m1 and m2, calls the multiply method, and prints the result. If the matrices are incompatible, it prints an error message.

Reasoning
Matrix Multiplication Logic: The program implements the standard matrix multiplication algorithm, which involves computing the dot product of rows and columns.

Error Handling: The program checks for incompatible matrix sizes and handles them gracefully by returning a null matrix and printing an error message.
